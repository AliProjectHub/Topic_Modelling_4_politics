# Topic Modelling 4 politics

:sparkles: Welcome to this repo documenting my final submission to the Seminar Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing at Humboldt University Berlin. 

## Content
:snake: Python Notebook (as .ipynb)

:data_folder: Data Input Files needed to sucessfully execute the Notebook 

## How to get started
:chains: To make your life easy, the Notebook takes the Data Input Files directly from this repo. 

:bar_chart: Alternatively, you may download the files contained in this repo. 

:warning: In that case you will evidently need to adjust the input paths.

:rocket: You are now ready to rock n' roll! 

:sunny: Have fun!
